Trainer Pool and Evaluation Dashboard
A web-based Trainer Pool and Evaluation Dashboard built with Django (backend) and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (frontend) to efficiently track, evaluate, and rank trainers based on performance and feedback.

Key Features:
Secure Authentication: Implemented a login system for both Admins and Trainers, ensuring secure access using unique credentials.
Admin Dashboard: Provides tools for Trainer List Management, Performance Summary, Leaderboard Trends, Profile Management, and Student Feedback Analysis, improving administrative efficiency.
Trainer Dashboard: Allows trainers to view/edit their profiles, access a self-evaluation form, and track their performance. Updates are reflected in the Admin Dashboard.
Google Sheets Integration: Fetches student feedback data from Google Forms via the Google Sheets API for automated and accurate data retrieval.
Automated Scoring Algorithm: Evaluates trainers based on achievements, classes conducted, workshops held, student participation, and competition wins to ensure fair assessment.
Leaderboard System: Categorizes trainers into performance tiers:
Top Performers (>80%)
Good Performers (60-80%)
Average Performers (40-60%)
Below Average (20-40%)
Underperformers (<20%)
Ensures transparency in ranking and motivates trainers for better engagement.
Real-Time Feedback Integration: Student feedback scores are automatically added to the trainer's total points, enhancing evaluation accuracy.
This project streamlines trainer evaluation and ranking, fostering a transparent, data-driven performance management system. ðŸš€
